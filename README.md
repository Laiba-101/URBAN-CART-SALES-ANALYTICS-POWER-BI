# URBAN-CART-SALES-ANALYTICS-POWER-BI
**OBJECTIVE:** The purpose of the Urban Cart Sales Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and interactive visual representation of the company's sales performance.

**Key Highlights and Insights:**
The profit trends show fluctuations throughout the year, with notable peaks in July, September, and November. There are also periods of low or negative profit, particularly in January and April. The total profit is 37K.
The states contributing the most to profit are Uttar Pradesh (3.4K), Tamil Nadu (2.6K), and West Bengal (2.1K) while Sikkim shows a modest profit (0.4K), while Rajasthan reports a negative profit (-0.3K).
The most frequently used payment method is Cash on Delivery (COD), with 672 transactions.
Clothing appears to be the dominant category, followed by Electronics and Furniture.
The orders span from December 19, 2018, to December 30, 2018, indicating recent customer activity. The sum of average order value is 121K.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**
Focus on Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal for future marketing efforts as they are generating significant profit and investigate the reasons behind the low performance in states like Rajasthan.
Since COD is highly popular, consider expanding this option to more regions to attract more customers.
While Clothing is the leading category, ensure diversification and growth in Furniture and Electronics to balance profit sources.
Capitalize on months with high profit by planning ahead for seasonal promotions and ensuring adequate stock and staffing during these periods.
Overall, the dashboard indicates healthy profit margins with specific areas showing potential for growth and optimization.
